# QC and QML

- Casual interest in the field based on a lifelong passion and deep respect for Physics and the physical world in which it models. For so long in a classical way, but with ever evolving insights into a deeper reality or illusion of it.
- Part philosophical, part scientific, mostly dabbling.
- Also trying out Rust lang to develop an intuition for systems programming.
